# Data Structure using Swift

This repository was created with the purpose of reviewing and consolidating my knowledge of Data Structures using Swift. Throughout this project, I will cover various topics such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and sorting and searching algorithms, among other fundamental concepts.

The idea is to practice the implementation of these structures and algorithms, as well as explore their complexities and practical uses. This repository will serve as a personal reference to revisit concepts and as a space to share my progress with other developers interested in the topic.

## Topics to be covered:

- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ] Big O notation
- [ ] Stacks & Queues
- [ ] Hash Tables
- [ ] Binary Trees
- [ ] Dynamic Programming & Memoization
- [ ] Bubble Sort / Merge Sort / Quick Sort
